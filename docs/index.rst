Building Technology Assessment Platform (BTAP): Machine Learning Implementation
===============================================================================

Based on a whole building energy simulation engine, BTAP calculates capital and operating costs, energy consumption 
and demand, and related GHG emissions for over 60,000 difference referene housing and building models. This supports 
the development of the next generation of building codes for new housing and the development of the first code on 
alternations to existing buildings. It also supports the building industry in the cost effective design of solutions 
to meet energy consumption, cost, and GHG targets.

Through the use of surrogate models, machine learning is being used to try to improve the overall processing time 
associated with calculating such a large solution space. Even with High Performance Computing, calculating the entire 
stock of models is estimated to take 57 centuries. Surrogate models significantly reduce the time and resources 
required to produce usable outputs.
